HTML presentation templates for Mozilla
=======================================

This is the repository with HTML format.

Changes in this version:

* Firefox OS pick and mix overview deck (firefox-os-pick-and-mix.html)
* Fullscreen button (as requested by Stormy Peters)
* Overall cleanup of the CSS (different list styles, live CSS code)
* Pressing "N" in fullscreen mode toggles note display
* In list mode, each slide has a "x" button to turn it on and off. This does not persist though, so when you reload your slides, it will make them all active again (TODO I guess)
* Support for multilingual slides, with URLs that update. Toggle the menu option to get the text in your desired language.
* Moved out to a dedicated repository, originally from https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-presentation-templates

Next steps:

* Persist Toggle slides feature

Known issues:

* Slide printing sometimes doesn't work properly
